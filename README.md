# TechSTART November: Git Ready, Set, Commit!

A Beginner's Guide to Git & Collaboration

This project is a collaborative bulletin board webpage where participants of the TechSTART November workshop can add their messages, quotes, or "I was here" notes. The webpage is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is deployed via GitHub Pages.

## 📋 How It Works

1. Participants fork this repository to their GitHub account
2. They create their own message file in the `messages/` folder (e.g., `messages/their-username.json`)
3. They create a pull request to merge their changes
4. Once merged, their message automatically appears on the live webpage!
